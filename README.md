# Titanic: Predicting Passenger Survival

## üìå **Description**  
This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" case, applying a pipeline that reflects real-world Machine Learning applications in industry and market-related problems. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and the approach includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of various machine learning models. Additionally, I have included a brief introduction to Linear Regression to assist those who may not have a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations behind this ML model.

The project follows these steps:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Üí Understanding the data through descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Mining** ‚Üí Cleaning the data and performing feature engineering.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Splitting** ‚Üí Dividing the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Application** ‚Üí Testing different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Evaluation** ‚Üí Computing metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Output** ‚Üí Exporting results to a CSV file.
