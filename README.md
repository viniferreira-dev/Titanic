# Titanic: Predicting Passenger Survival

## 📌 **Description**  
This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" case, applying a pipeline that reflects real-world Machine Learning applications in industry and market-related problems. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and the approach includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of various machine learning models. Additionally, I have included a brief introduction to Linear Regression to assist those who may not have a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations behind this ML model.

The project follows these steps:  

1️. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the data through descriptive statistics and visualizations.

2️. **Data Mining:** Cleaning the data and performing feature engineering.  

3️. **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.  

4️. **Model Application:** Testing different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks.  

5️. **Model Evaluation:** Computing metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.  

6️. **Final Output:** Exporting results to a CSV file.
