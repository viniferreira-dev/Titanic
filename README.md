The project follows these steps:  
1️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Understanding the data through descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
2️⃣ **Data Mining** → Cleaning the data and performing feature engineering.  
3️⃣ **Data Splitting** → Dividing the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.  
4️⃣ **Model Application** → Testing different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks.  
5️⃣ **Model Evaluation** → Computing metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.  
6️⃣ **Final Output** → Exporting results to a CSV file.
