# Titanic: Predicting Passenger Survival

## üìå **Description**  
This project aims to do a complete analysis of the ![Titanic - Machine Learning from Disater case](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), apllying a pipeline that matches with what a real Machine Learning application looks like in problems of the industry/market. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and the approach includes exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and the application of different machine learning models. I also included a fast introduction about Linear Regression with the purpose to help those who dont have a deep understandment about the mathematical process behind this ML Model

The project follows these steps:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Üí Understanding the data through descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Mining** ‚Üí Cleaning the data and performing feature engineering.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Splitting** ‚Üí Dividing the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Application** ‚Üí Testing different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Evaluation** ‚Üí Computing metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Output** ‚Üí Exporting results to a CSV file.
